- **Safe**: No hidden malicious code—just transparent, community-vetted mods.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to use the code to create your own mods or add features to the menu.
- **Community-Driven**: Anyone can contribute, making this a truly collaborative effort.

- **Stats Tracking**: Track in-game stats like playtime, wins, and more.
- **Safe & Secure**: All code is open-source and reviewed by the community.
